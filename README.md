#### DESCRIPTION

In this game, two players take turns rolling a dice by pressing a button.
In one move, the player rolls the dice as many times as they want, and the points are summed up. 
The turn passes to the next player as soon as they decide to keep the points scored, or they get 1 on a dice. 
In this case, current scored points are canceled, and the next player begins to play. 
The winner is the one who reaches 100 scores first.
